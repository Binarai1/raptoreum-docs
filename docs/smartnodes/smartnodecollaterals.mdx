# Smartnode Collaterals

:::note

Smartnode collateral does ramp up which you can see below. You can send a larger amount so you dont need to update when the collateral amount increases. As an example letâ€™s say you are setting up a smartnode when the required collateral amount is 5000 RTM, you can instead send a collateral of 10,000 RTM. Here is the current Smartnode collateral schedule:

:::

```
Block 0 > 88720 = 600,000 RTM
Block 88721 > 132720 = 800,000 RTM
Block 132721 > 176720 = 1,000,000 RTM
Block 176721 > 220720 = 1,250,000 RTM
Block 220721 > 264720 = 1,500,000 RTM
Block 264721 > forever = 1,800,000 RTM
```
